      "Established in honor of John & Lindy’s son, Christopher Blanchard, this particular program is very dear to the Blanchard family. Dana Blanchard, or Mama Dana as she is more commonly referred to at Mtendere, lived on site during the initial development, and she returns each summer to spend the season with her Malawian family. The heart of the program is to be His hands and feet by caring for the children at Mtendere, and meeting their spiritual, physical, academic, and emotional needs.\n",

Previous positions at the Alaska DMV include oversight of all large field offices and leading the driver licensing program.\\nMellott serves on the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators Unconventional Vehicle Working Group and has worked collaboratively with representatives from across the country to develop best practices for states to follow when it comes to titling rebuilt, reconstructed and re-bodied vehicles.\\nShe grew up in a family that operated a trucking company and spent several years as a truck driver giving her first-hand experience of the importance and challenges of the motor carrier industry.\\nWhat brought you to YPP? I was looking for a job and I had got a text message from my friend and he asked me if I wanted to join YPP and I said yeah.\\nWhat do you enjoy most about YPP? What I enjoy the most is being able to mature and having more patience with the kids.\\nWhy do you think YPP is important? I think YPP is important because I feel like it will help educate young kids on their math skills and we’re giving back to the community.\\nHow has participating in YPP affected you? In YPP affected me by helping me improve on my growth about education and helped my character.'}"
